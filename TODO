DOCS
- monitor api documentation, all around
- prose documentation on good patterns
  - graceful restart:
    * SIGUSR2 master
    * once new workers are all up (see READY NOTIFICATION below),
      SIGQUIT old master
  - graceful restart with rollback option
    * SIGUSR2 master
    * once new workers are all up, SIGWINCH old master
    * monitor, test
    * a) all is good, so SIGQUIT old master
      b) all is not good, so:
         * SIGHUP old master
         * once new workers for old master are up, SIGQUIT new master

LOGGING
- rename logger for access log to "feather.log.access"
- rename logger for error log to "feather.log.error"
- have the monitor log to logger "feather.monitor"
- look into more logging for other parts of feather
- a configure_logging() function in __init__.py like greenhouse's

HOOKS
- evaluate what arguments should be passed into each hook
* pre_worker_fork
* worker_postfork
* worker_forked
* worker_exited

MANAGEMENT
- workers should be numbered
  - when a worker dies the replacement gets the same number as the one
    it replaces
  - worker_postfork, worker_forked and worker_exited hooks should be
    passed both the worker number and pid of the affected worker
- create .pid files with names generated from the worker number

READY NOTIFICATION
- create a programmatic means by which a new monitor master indicates
  that all its children are up and ready to serve
- purpose:
    it will make the graceful restart process possible for a script.
    as it is, there is no way to know that a new master's workers are
    all up and running and therefore that it is safe to kill off the
    old master.
- proposal:
  * all feather servers get a 'ready' attribute, it is a
    greenhouse.util.Event that gets set as the last thing to happen
    before it enters the accept loop
  * before forking the children, monitor master creates a pipe
  * each child, once the ready event has been set, grabs an fcntl lock
    on the master's pid file and writes its own pid to the pipe
  * once it has heard from all the children it just started, the
    master writes a null byte to a file. filename is configured along
    with pidfiles etc, if left null then no notification is given
