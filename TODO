DOCS
- monitor api documentation, all around
- prose documentation on good patterns
  - graceful restart:
    * SIGUSR2 master
    * once new workers are all up (see READY NOTIFICATION below),
      SIGQUIT old master
  - graceful restart with rollback option
    * SIGUSR2 master
    * once new workers are all up, SIGWINCH old master
    * monitor, test
    * a) all is good, so SIGQUIT old master
      b) all is not good, so:
         * SIGHUP old master
         * once new workers for old master are up, SIGQUIT new master
